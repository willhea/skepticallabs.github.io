## About Skeptical Labs LLC

Skeptical Labs LLC is a solo consulting practice based in Arlington, VA. We specialize in operations consulting for startups and government clients.

The company was founded on a simple principle:

> Solve the most interesting problems, for the best clients, with the most talented people, to live the lives we choose, all the time.

We deliberately operate as a lean, single-member LLC. This structure allows us to focus on client work rather than managing overhead, and to take on projects that genuinely interest us.
