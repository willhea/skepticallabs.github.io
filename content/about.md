## About Skeptical Labs LLC

Skeptical Labs LLC is a management and operations consulting practice based in Arlington, VA. We specialize in helping startups and government clients build operational systems that work.

The company was founded on a simple principle:

> Solve the most interesting problems, for the best clients, with the most talented people, to live the lives we choose, all the time.

We focus on client work, not overhead. Every engagement is designed to deliver measurable results and leave your team better equipped to maintain the systems we build. See our [Services](/services/) for details on how we work.

## How We Work With Clients

Every engagement starts the same way: you define the goal and success criteria, and we own how to get there. That includes system selection, process design, implementation, and documentation.

We start by building shared dashboards and reporting so your team and ours are looking at the same numbers. From there, we design and build the operational systems to hit the target. Everything we build is documented and designed to run after we leave.

## Track Record

Our team has delivered measurable results across startups and federal agencies:

- **Operation Warp Speed:** Primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine temperature monitoring, managing a $20M+ annual contract. Received Letter of Commendation from General Gustave Perna and recognition from President Biden.
- **DOJ Criminal Division:** Built Talent Tracker, reducing attorney clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days. 2016 DOJ Innovation Award.
- **Department of Energy:** Took over a ServiceNow project and achieved ATO approval in under 5 months while reducing staffing costs 75%.
- **Seed-stage startups:** Built first accurate churn and revenue reporting, reduced book close from 2+ months to 3 days, recovered $80K+ in bad debt.
