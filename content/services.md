## What We Do

We help organizations that are stuck. Whether you've inherited a mess, can't get accurate data, or need to fix broken processes, we build the systems and visibility to move forward.

---

## Operations Consulting

**Problem:** Your operations are chaotic. Teams are firefighting. Nobody knows what's working.

**Solution:** We map your current state, identify bottlenecks, and build systems that create visibility and accountability.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Reduced book close time from 2+ months to 3 business days
- Cut delinquent invoices from 30% to 0%
- Recovered $80K+ in bad debt through process improvements

---

## Data & Reporting

**Problem:** You have data in multiple systems but no single source of truth. Decisions are made on gut feel.

**Solution:** We connect your systems, build dashboards, and create the reporting infrastructure you need to make data-driven decisions.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Built first accurate churn and revenue reporting for a seed-stage startup
- Created real-time financial dashboards replacing manual spreadsheet reconciliation
- Identified pricing and retention issues that were invisible before

## Federal Contracting

**Problem:** Your government project is behind schedule, over budget, or failing to deliver.

**Solution:** We bring private-sector agility to federal environments, navigating compliance while actually shipping.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Achieved ATO approval in under 5 months on a project 12 months behind schedule
- Reduced attorney clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days (2016 DOJ Innovation Award)
- Managed $20M+ annual contract for Operation Warp Speed vaccine monitoring

## Fractional Leadership

**Problem:** You need experienced operations leadership but aren't ready for a full-time hire.

**Solution:** We provide interim COO/Director-level support, building the foundation for your eventual full-time leader.

**Typical engagements:**
- 3-6 month engagements
- Part-time or project-based
- Focus on systems and processes that outlast our engagement

## How We Work

1. **Discovery:** We start by understanding your situation. No generic playbooks.
2. **Diagnosis:** We identify root causes, not just symptoms.
3. **Build:** We create systems, processes, and visibility.
4. **Transfer:** We document everything so your team can maintain it.

We optimize for results, not billable hours. Engagements are typically flat-fee or milestone-based.
