## What We Do

We build operational systems for organizations at inflection points. We work alongside your team in the data and the tools, design the dashboards and processes they need, and document everything so it runs without us.

---

## Operations Consulting

**When you need:** Visibility into complex, fast-moving operations. Your team is growing, priorities are competing, and you need systems that scale.

**What we build:** We map your current state, identify the highest-leverage opportunities, and build the dashboards, reporting, and processes your team needs to track progress and make decisions. We bring project management discipline (Agile, waterfall, or hybrid) to move things forward.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Reduced book close time from 2+ months to 3 business days, enabling accurate monthly financials for the first time
- Cut delinquent invoices from 30% to 0% through systematic process design
- Recovered $80K+ in outstanding debt by identifying root causes in the invoicing workflow

## Data & Reporting

**When you need:** A single source of truth. Your data lives in multiple systems and you need it connected so decisions are based on complete information.

**What we build:** We connect your systems, build dashboards, and create the reporting infrastructure for data-driven decisions.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Built first accurate churn and revenue reporting for a startup, revealing retention insights that drove strategic changes
- Created real-time financial dashboards replacing hours of manual spreadsheet reconciliation
- Identified pricing gaps and customer segments that were invisible without consolidated data

---

## Federal Contracting

**When you need:** Private-sector agility in a federal environment. Your government project needs experienced leadership that understands both compliance and delivery.

**What we build:** We navigate federal compliance requirements while delivering on schedule and on budget.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Achieved ATO approval for a Department of Energy ServiceNow project in under 5 months while reducing staffing costs 75%
- Reduced DOJ attorney clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days with Talent Tracker (2016 DOJ Innovation Award)
- Managed $20M+ annual contract for Operation Warp Speed, serving as primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer vaccine temperature monitoring

---

## Fractional Leadership

**When you need:** Experienced operations or product leadership for a specific phase of growth.

**What we build:** We embed as interim COO/CPO/Director-level operators. We build the operational systems, reporting, and processes your team needs, and document everything so it runs without us.

**Typical engagements:**
- Part-time or project-based
- Operations, project management, or product management focus
- Outcome-driven: defined goals with measurable results
- Systems and processes designed to outlast the engagement

## How We Work

1. **Discovery:** We start by understanding your situation. No generic playbooks.
2. **Diagnosis:** We identify root causes, not just symptoms.
3. **Build:** We create systems, processes, and visibility.
4. **Transfer:** We document everything so your team can maintain it.

We bring operations, project management, and product management expertise to every engagement. We optimize for results, not hours.

## Who We Work Best With

We deliver the strongest results when:

- **Goals and metrics are shared:** Your team tracks key numbers (or wants to start), and leadership uses data to make decisions. We accelerate this by building dashboards and reporting from day one.
- **We own the approach:** You define what success looks like. We choose the tools, design the systems, and build the solution.
- **The organization is ready for real tools:** We build on databases, cloud platforms, and modern software. The environment doesn't need to be cutting-edge, just open to adopting what works.
- **Something needs to be built:** Scaling operations, launching a new program, creating reporting that doesn't exist yet. That's where we do our best work.
