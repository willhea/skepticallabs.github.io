## What We Do

We help organizations at inflection points. Whether you're navigating a transition, need better data visibility, or want to improve your processes, we build the systems to move forward.

---

## Operations Consulting

**Problem:** Your operations are complex and fast-moving. Teams are stretched across competing priorities. Visibility is limited.

**Solution:** We map your current state, identify bottlenecks, and build systems that create visibility and accountability. We bring project management discipline (Agile, waterfall, or hybrid) to get things moving.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Reduced book close time from 2+ months to 3 business days at a seed-stage company, enabling accurate monthly financials for the first time
- Cut delinquent invoices from 30% to 0% through systematic follow-up processes
- Recovered $80K+ in bad debt by identifying and addressing root causes in the invoicing workflow

## Data & Reporting

**Problem:** You have data in multiple systems but no single source of truth. Decisions are made on incomplete information.

**Solution:** We connect your systems, build dashboards, and create the reporting infrastructure you need to make data-driven decisions.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Built first accurate churn and revenue reporting for a seed-stage startup, revealing retention issues that drove strategic changes
- Created real-time financial dashboards replacing hours of manual spreadsheet reconciliation each month
- Identified pricing gaps and customer segments that were invisible without consolidated data

## Federal Contracting

**Problem:** Your government project is behind schedule, over budget, or failing to deliver.

**Solution:** We bring private-sector agility to federal environments, navigating compliance while delivering results.

**Results we've delivered:**
- Took over a Department of Energy ServiceNow project and achieved ATO approval in under 5 months while reducing staffing costs 75%
- Reduced DOJ attorney clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days with Talent Tracker (2016 DOJ Innovation Award)
- Managed $20M+ annual contract for Operation Warp Speed, serving as primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer vaccine temperature monitoring

---

## Fractional Leadership

**Problem:** You need experienced operations or product leadership but aren't ready for a full-time hire.

**Solution:** We provide interim COO/CPO/Director-level support, building the foundation for your eventual full-time leader.

**Typical engagements:**
- 3-6 month engagements
- Part-time or project-based
- Operations, project management, or product management focus
- Systems and processes that last

## How We Work

1. **Discovery:** We start by understanding your situation. No generic playbooks.
2. **Diagnosis:** We identify root causes, not just symptoms.
3. **Build:** We create systems, processes, and visibility.
4. **Transfer:** We document everything so your team can maintain it.

We bring operations, project management, and product management expertise to every engagement. We optimize for results, not billable hours. Engagements are typically flat-fee or milestone-based.
