[{"content":" About Skeptical Labs LLC # Skeptical Labs LLC is a management and operations consulting practice based in Arlington, VA. We specialize in helping startups and government clients build operational systems that work.\nThe company was founded on a simple principle:\nSolve the most interesting problems, for the best clients, with the most talented people, to live the lives we choose, all the time.\nWe focus on client work, not overhead. Every engagement is designed to deliver measurable results and leave your team better equipped to maintain the systems we build. See our Services for details on how we work.\nHow We Work With Clients # Every engagement starts the same way: you define the goal and success criteria, and we own how to get there. That includes system selection, process design, implementation, and documentation.\nWe start by building shared dashboards and reporting so your team and ours are looking at the same numbers. From there, we design and build the operational systems to hit the target. Everything we build is documented and designed to run after we leave.\nTrack Record # Our team has delivered measurable results across startups and federal agencies:\nOperation Warp Speed: Primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine temperature monitoring, managing a $20M+ annual contract.

We work alongside your team in the data and the tools, design the dashboards and processes they need, and document everything so it runs without us.\nOperations Consulting # When you need: Visibility into complex, fast-moving operations. Your team is growing, priorities are competing, and you need systems that scale.\nWhat we build: We map your current state, identify the highest-leverage opportunities, and build the dashboards, reporting, and processes your team needs to track progress and make decisions. We bring project management discipline (Agile, waterfall, or hybrid) to move things forward.\nResults we\u0026rsquo;ve delivered:\nReduced book close time from 2+ months to 3 business days, enabling accurate monthly financials for the first time Cut delinquent invoices from 30% to 0% through systematic process design Recovered $80K+ in outstanding debt by identifying root causes in the invoicing workflow Data \u0026amp; Reporting # When you need: A single source of truth. Your data lives in multiple systems and you need it connected so decisions are based on complete information.\nWhat we build: We connect your systems, build dashboards, and create the reporting infrastructure for data-driven decisions.\nResults we\u0026rsquo;ve delivered:\nBuilt first accurate churn and revenue reporting for a startup, revealing retention insights that drove strategic changes Created real-time financial dashboards replacing hours of manual spreadsheet reconciliation Identified pricing gaps and customer segments that were invisible without consolidated data Federal Contracting # When you need: Private-sector agility in a federal environment. Your government project needs experienced leadership that understands both compliance and delivery.\nWhat we build: We navigate federal compliance requirements while delivering on schedule and on budget.\nResults we\u0026rsquo;ve delivered:\nAchieved ATO approval for a Department of Energy ServiceNow project in under 5 months while reducing staffing costs 75% Reduced DOJ attorney clearance times from 1-2 years to under 90 days with Talent Tracker (2016 DOJ Innovation Award) Managed $20M+ annual contract for Operation Warp Speed, serving as primary U.S. point of contact for Pfizer vaccine temperature monitoring Fractional Leadership # When you need: Experienced operations or product leadership for a specific phase of growth.\nWhat we build: We embed as interim COO/CPO/Director-level operators. We build the operational systems, reporting, and processes your team needs, and document everything so it runs without us.\nTypical engagements:\nPart-time or project-based Operations, project management, or product management focus Outcome-driven: defined goals with measurable results Systems and processes designed to outlast the engagement How We Work # Discovery: We start by understanding your situation. No generic playbooks. Diagnosis: We identify root causes, not just symptoms. Build: We create systems, processes, and visibility. Transfer: We document everything so your team can maintain it. We bring operations, project management, and product management expertise to every engagement. We optimize for results, not hours.\nWho We Work Best With # We deliver the strongest results when:\nGoals and metrics are shared: Your team tracks key numbers (or wants to start), and leadership uses data to make decisions. We accelerate this by building dashboards and reporting from day one. We own the approach: You define what success looks like. We choose the tools, design the systems, and build the solution. The organization is ready for real tools: We build on databases, cloud platforms, and modern software. The environment doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be cutting-edge, just open to adopting what works. Something needs to be built: Scaling operations, launching a new program, creating reporting that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist yet. That\u0026rsquo;s where we do our best work.
